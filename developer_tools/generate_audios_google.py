"""
Usage:
    Run this script to generate all audio files from `sentences.json` using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.
    It uses Google's neural TTS to synthesize high-quality Mandarin audio.
    
    Prerequisites:
    1. Install google-cloud-texttospeech: pip install google-cloud-texttospeech
    2. Set up Google Cloud credentials:
       - Create a service account and download the JSON key file
       - Set environment variable: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/key.json
       OR
       - Run: gcloud auth application-default login
    
    python generate_audios_google.py
