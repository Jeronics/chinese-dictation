# Story Resume Feature

## Overview
The Chinese Dictation app now supports saving and resuming story progress. Users can save their progress at any point during a story session and resume later from where they left off.

## Features

### Save & Resume Later
- **Save Progress**: Users can click "ðŸ’¾ Save & Resume Later" during any story session to save their current progress
- **Resume Later**: When returning to a story, users will automatically resume from their last saved position
- **Progress Tracking**: The system tracks:
  - Current part index
  - Current score
  - Total parts in the story
  - Last updated timestamp

### Restart Story
- **Restart Option**: Users can click "ðŸ”„ Restart Story" to clear all progress and start over
- **Clean Slate**: This completely removes any saved progress for the story

### Visual Indicators
- **Story List**: Stories with saved progress show "ðŸ”„ Resume Practice" instead of "â–¶ Start Practice"
- **Notifications**: Flash messages inform users when:
  - Progress is successfully saved
  - Story is resumed from a saved position
  - Progress save fails
  - User needs to log in to save progress

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The feature uses a `story_progress` table with the following structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE story_progress (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    story_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    current_index INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    score INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    total_parts INTEGER NOT NULL,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(user_id, story_id)
);
```

### User Experience
1. **Logged-in Users**: Can save and resume progress across devices
2. **Guest Users**: Can use the feature during their session, but progress is not saved permanently
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Progress is automatically cleared when a story is completed

### Accessibility
- High contrast color schemes for colorblind users
- Clear visual indicators and focus states
- Screen reader friendly button labels
